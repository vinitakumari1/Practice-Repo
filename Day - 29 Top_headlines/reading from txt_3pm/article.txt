The United States and India recently announced a rollback of certain tariffs 
imposed during previous trade disputes. The move is expected to boost bilateral trade, 
particularly in sectors like agriculture, electronics, and manufacturing. 
Economists believe this step will enhance market access and reduce costs for exporters on both sides,
while signaling improved geopolitical alignment between the two democracies.
