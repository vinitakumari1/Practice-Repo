router = APIRouter()

# ‚úÖ Meaning of router = APIRouter()
# APIRouter is a class from FastAPI used to group related API endpoints.

# You create a router object with it, just like you create an app with FastAPI().

# Instead of registering routes directly on the app, you register them on the router.

# Later, you include the router into the main app using app.include_router(router).


# üìå Benefits of Using APIRouter
# Benefit	Description
# üîå Modular	Keeps code organized by splitting routes across files
# ‚ôªÔ∏è Reusable	You can reuse routers in multiple apps/microservices
# üß± Scalable	Easy to add routers for users, books, orders, etc.
# üóÇÔ∏è Tagged Docs	Each router can have its own section in Swagger UI
