# 🌦️ Weather Forecast Management API  

A FastAPI application to **fetch, store, and benchmark weather forecasts** using both **SQL (PostgreSQL/MySQL/SQLite)** and **MongoDB**.  

This project demonstrates:  
✅ Building APIs with FastAPI  
✅ Using Pydantic for request validation  
✅ SQLAlchemy ORM with relational DB  
✅ MongoDB integration with indexes  
✅ Benchmarking queries across SQL vs Mongo  
✅ Clean, modular architecture (services, routers, models, DB layers)

## 🚀 Features
- Fetch weather forecasts from **OpenWeather API** (next 24 hours in 3-hour intervals).  
- Save forecasts into **SQL + MongoDB** simultaneously.  
- Manage saved reports via CRUD endpoints (file + DB).  
- Benchmark SQL vs Mongo query performance.  
- Well-documented and production-ready codebase.
