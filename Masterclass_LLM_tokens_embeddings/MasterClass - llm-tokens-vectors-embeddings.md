## 🧠 Section 1. Introduction to AI Models


In the simplest terms, a **model** in artificial intelligence (AI) is a mathematical function or system that has been trained to perform a specific task.

For example:
- A model can classify emails as "spam" or "not spam."
- A language model, like GPT, predicts the next word in a sequence.

### Key Concepts:
- **Training Data:** Data used to teach the model patterns.
- **Parameters:** Internal variables of the model that are adjusted during training to minimize errors.
- **Inference:** Using the trained model to make predictions.

AI models can range from small systems to **Large Language Models (LLMs)** such as GPT-2 and GPT-4.

## 🧠 Section 2. What are Large Language Models (LLMs)?

**Large Language Models (LLMs)** are AI models trained on massive datasets of text to understand and generate human-like language.

### Characteristics of LLMs:
- They use **transformer architectures** to process sequences of text.
- They can handle a wide range of tasks, from writing essays to solving coding problems.
- Their ability is largely determined by the **scale of data** and **number of parameters.**

Examples include:
- **GPT-2:** Introduced in 2019 with 1.5 billion parameters.
- **GPT-4:** Released in 2023 with advanced reasoning abilities and support for up to 128k tokens.

## 🧠 Section 3. The Evolution from GPT-2 to GPT-4

The Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) series has evolved significantly.
### Here's a breakdown of the acronym:
- Generative:
GPT models can generate new text, essentially creating content that didn't exist before, like continuing a conversation or writing a story.
- Pre-trained:
These models are trained on massive datasets of text before being used for specific tasks, giving them a broad understanding of language and context.
- Transformer:
This refers to the specific type of neural network architecture that GPT models use, which excels at processing sequential data like text. 

### **GPT-2**
- Released by OpenAI in 2019.
- 1.5 billion parameters.
- Context window: 1,024 tokens.
- Known for generating coherent but sometimes nonsensical text.

### **GPT-3**
- 175 billion parameters.
- Capable of better reasoning and language tasks.

### **GPT-4**
- Estimated hundreds of billions to over a trillion parameters.
- Context window: up to 128,000 tokens in some variants.
- Better at following instructions, reasoning, and long-form content generation.

### Key Difference in Context Handling:
- **GPT-2** could only handle short conversations due to its small **context window**.
- **GPT-4** can process **entire books** or long technical documents in one go.

## 🧠 Section 4. Understanding Tokens

**Tokens** are the basic units of text that models like GPT-2 and GPT-4 understand.

### What is a Token?
- A token can be a word, part of a word, or even punctuation.
- Example: "ChatGPT is amazing!" → ["Chat", "G", "PT", " is", " amazing", "!"]

### Why Tokens Matter:
- The context window of models is measured in tokens (e.g., GPT-4 with 128k tokens).
- The **tokenization** process impacts how the model reads and processes input.

### Tokenization Example:
#### 🚀If You Want to split the input text into subword tokens
```python
from transformers import GPT2Tokenizer
tokenizer = GPT2Tokenizer.from_pretrained("gpt2")
tokens = tokenizer.tokenize("I love machine learning!")
print("Tokens:", tokens)
```
#### 🧾 Output
```
Tokens: ['I', 'Ġlove', 'Ġmachine', 'Ġlearning', '!']
```
- `Ġ` represents a space.
- These tokens will be converted to numerical IDs to feed into the model.


#### 🚀If You Want Token IDs Instead of Strings
You can get the token IDs (the numerical representation) like this:

```python
input_ids = tokenizer.encode("ChatGPT is amazing.")
print(input_ids)

```
#### 🧾 Output
```
[4794, 292, 1271, 13]
```
#### 🚀To get token ids as tensors
```python
inputs = tokenizer("I love GPT-2!", return_tensors="pt")
print(inputs)
```
#### 🧾 Output
```
{
  'input_ids': tensor([[40, 1574, 287, 50256]]),
  'attention_mask': tensor([[1, 1, 1, 1]])
}
```
### Tokens in GPT-2 vs GPT-4:
- GPT-2: Limited to 1,024 tokens (cannot handle long conversations).
- GPT-4: Can handle large conversations or documents due to its extended token limit.

## 🧠 Section 5. Chunking :
### What is chunking ? 
To split a long piece of text into smaller token-based chunks to be used in LLMs like GPT-2 or for vector embeddings (e.g., with FAISS + OpenAI)

### Why is chunking important
Chunking ensures the text fits within the token limit, allowing the model to process long documents in manageable pieces.

### 🔄 Why is Chunking Important in GPT-2 and GPT-4?

Chunking helps break large text inputs into manageable segments that LLMs (like GPT-2 and GPT-4) can process efficiently. Here’s a summary of why it's essential:

| **Benefit**                | **Explanation**                                                                 |
|---------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 🚫 Avoids token overflow   | Prevents input truncation or API errors by staying within token limits          |
| 🎯 Enhances semantic focus | Helps create more meaningful embeddings by isolating focused topic segments     |
| 💸 Reduces cost            | Smaller chunks mean fewer tokens → reduced cost per API call                    |
| ⚡ Improves response quality| LLMs generate better answers with more relevant and contextual inputs           |
| 📄 Enables long-doc QA     | Makes GPT usable with large documents like resumes, PDFs, articles, and books   |

### 🔍 Token Limits in GPT Models

| **Model** | **Max Tokens** |
|----------|----------------|
| GPT-2    | 1024 tokens    |
| GPT-3    | 4096 tokens    |
| GPT-4    | 8192–128k tokens |

## 🧠 Real-World Scenario: Resume QnA

**Without Chunking:**
> ❌ GPT-4 input is too long → truncates resume → skills section lost → inaccurate result

**With Chunking:**
> ✅ Resume split into 500-token chunks → Only skill-related chunk retrieved → Accurate GPT-4 answer

## 🧠 Section 6. Embeddings and Vectors

### What are Embeddings?
Embeddings are numerical representations of text that capture **semantic meaning.**

Example:
- The words "king" and "queen" will have similar embeddings because they are semantically related.

### Why Use Embeddings?
- To enable **semantic search** and **text similarity comparison.**

### Vector Representations
An embedding is stored as a **vector** (array of floating-point numbers), e.g.:
```
"dog" → [0.12, -0.34, 0.56, ...]
"cat" → [0.10, -0.30, 0.52, ...]
```

### GPT and Embeddings:
- GPT models produce embeddings using their internal layers.
- OpenAI provides embedding models like `text-embedding-ada-002` for vector search.\

### 🚀 Example: Embeddings with GPT-2
```python
from transformers import GPT2Tokenizer, GPT2Model
import torch

#  1. Load pre-trained GPT-2 tokenizer
# This tokenizer knows how to split text into tokens the same way GPT-2 was trained.
tokenizer = GPT2Tokenizer.from_pretrained("gpt2")

#  2. Load pre-trained GPT-2 model (only the base transformer, no language head)
# This model returns embeddings and contextualized outputs.
model = GPT2Model.from_pretrained("gpt2")

#  3. Input text
text = "I want to study Python"

#  4. Tokenize the text and return as PyTorch tensors
# return_tensors="pt" tells tokenizer to return PyTorch tensors (pt = PyTorch)
inputs = tokenizer(text, return_tensors="pt")

#  5. Get embeddings from model
# torch.no_grad() disables gradient calculations (saves memory, we aren't training)
with torch.no_grad():
    outputs = model(**inputs)

#  6. Get the output of the final transformer layer
# outputs.last_hidden_state has shape: [batch_size, num_tokens, hidden_size]
# Each token has a 768-dimensional vector (for GPT2 base)
embeddings = outputs.last_hidden_state  # shape: [1, 5, 768] for this sentence

#  7. Get actual tokens for display
tokens = tokenizer.tokenize(text)

#  8. Print token and its corresponding 768-d vector
for i, token in enumerate(tokens):
    print(f" Token: {token}")
    print(f"Embedding (768 values):\n{embeddings[0][i]}") #\n is called carriage return)
   

  ```

### 🚀Example: Embeddings with GPT-4:

GPT-4 itself does not provide embeddings directly. It’s a chat/completion model, not an embedding model. However, OpenAI provides dedicated embedding models like:

- text-embedding-ada-002 (legacy, popular)

- text-embedding-3-small (newer)

- text-embedding-3-large (most accurate)

These are the models you use for vector embeddings in tasks like semantic search, similarity matching, RAG, etc.

Here’s a complete example using text-embedding-3-small, which you can conceptually use alongside GPT-4 in applications like retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).

```python
from openai import OpenAI
import os

# Setup
client = OpenAI(api_key=os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY"))

# Your input text
text = "Artificial Intelligence is revolutionizing the world."

# Generate embedding
response = client.embeddings.create(
    model="text-embedding-3-small",
    input=text
)

embedding_vector = response.data[0].embedding

# Output length and snippet
print("Length of embedding:", len(embedding_vector))
print("First 10 values of embedding:", embedding_vector[:10])
 ```

#### 🧾 Output
```
{
 Length of embedding: 1536
First 10 values of embedding:
[0.01234, -0.02345, 0.06789, 0.00123, -0.00567, 0.04567, 0.07890, -0.00321, 0.01112, -0.04321]
}
```

## 🧠 Section 7. Vector Search and Its Role

**Vector search** is a technique to find the most similar items in a dataset based on their embeddings.

### Use Cases:
- Searching documents by **meaning**, not just keywords.
- Building **chatbots** with contextual knowledge.

### How Vector Search Works:
1. Convert documents into embeddings (vectors).
2. Store the embeddings in a database or index.
3. For a query, generate its embedding and find the closest vectors.

### Metrics for Similarity:
- **Cosine similarity**: Measures the angle between vectors.
- **Euclidean distance (L2)**: Measures straight-line distance.

## 🧠 Section 8. FAISS: Facebook AI Similarity Search

**FAISS** is a library for efficient vector similarity search.

### Features:
- Developed by Facebook AI.
- Optimized for searching through **millions or billions of vectors.**
- Supports multiple indexing structures.

### Basic Example with FAISS:
```python
import faiss
import numpy as np

# Dimensions of embeddings
dimension = 128

# Create a FAISS index
index = faiss.IndexFlatL2(dimension)

# Create random vectors
vectors = np.random.random((1000, dimension)).astype('float32')

# Add to index
index.add(vectors)

# Query
query = np.random.random((1, dimension)).astype('float32')
distances, indices = index.search(query, k=5)
print(indices, distances)
```

---

## 🧠 Section 9. Using MongoDB for Vector Storage

**MongoDB Atlas** supports **native vector search.**

### How It Works:
- Store embeddings in a field as an array of floats.
- Use `$vectorSearch` queries to find similar embeddings.
```python
✅ Install dependencies:
pip install faiss-cpu pymongo openai

import faiss
import numpy as np
from pymongo import MongoClient
import openai
import uuid
import os

openai.api_key = os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")

# MongoDB setup
client = MongoClient("mongodb://localhost:27017/")
collection = client["faiss_demo"]["docs"]

# FAISS index
dim = 1536
index = faiss.IndexFlatL2(dim)
mapping = {}

def embed(text):
    res = openai.embeddings.create(model="text-embedding-3-small", input=text)
    return np.array(res.data[0].embedding, dtype="float32")

# Sample docs
docs = [
    {"name": "Alice", "text": "Python and SQL developer."},
    {"name": "Bob", "text": "FastAPI and MongoDB engineer."}
]

# Indexing
for i, doc in enumerate(docs):
    emb = embed(doc["text"]).reshape(1, -1)
    doc_id = str(uuid.uuid4())
    index.add(emb)
    mapping[i] = doc_id
    doc["_id"] = doc_id
    collection.insert_one(doc)

# Query
query = embed("Looking for FastAPI expert").reshape(1, -1)
D, I = index.search(query, k=1)

# Result
match = collection.find_one({"_id": mapping[I[0][0]]})
print(f"Top match: {match['name']} - {match['text']}")

```
